<p>Critical Tools is a software suite that I developed over the summer of 2014. I was working on a Mellon Foundation grant with Colorado College Music Professor Ryan Bañagale. I was part of a massive project to catalog the works of the great American composer George Gershwin. This project was really important for me, and I got to really develop my music transcription skills. At the same time, I was able to work on developing some applications that would help the overall process of creating the edition.

<p>Critical Tools consists of a couple of different functions that work together in a streamlined fashion. The user can in-process image files that represent a score, and certain metadata to each image. After the user has in-processed the images, they can enter in a particular measure they would like to view, and jump directly to it. The impetus for this project was that I had to spend so much of my time looking at source images, and I was getting a bit frustrated with keeping track of such a huge amount of source material. This project aimed to address some of my frustrations, and to create something that could be used down the line to boost productivity.
